# Thermostat Challenge

This challenge replicates the system of a Thermostat using JavaScript and Jasmine.

I approached this challennge in the following way:

1. Wrote out the test that showed what I was aiming for as per the user stories.
2. Ran Jasmine and used the error messages to write out the source-code.
3. Repeated this process until I had a fully functional passing test.

## Requirements:

The following requirements were satisfied:

1. Thermostat temperature starts at 20 degrees.
2. Temperature can be increased and decreased with an up / down function.
3. Power saving mode is on by default.
4. With power saving mode, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees.
5. Without power saving mode, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees.
6. The minimum temperature is 10 degrees.
7. Temperature can be reset to 20 degrees using a reset function.
8. Thermostats current energy usage can be shown (<18 : low-usage, <25 : medium-usage, higher : high-usage).
